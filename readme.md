# Tumblr Boilerplate

Tumblr Boilerplate is a base HTML framework for Tumblr themes.

The goal of Tumblr Boilerplate is to provide a barebones HTML framework for advanced Tumblr theme designers, without ruining functionality and usability, so theme designers can focus mostly on CSS.

## Features

### Core features

Tumblr Boilerplate includes almost all style classes included within the [themes documentation](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes), complete with grab-and-go advanced features features that can be easily applied, like Google Analytics tracking, Disqus comments, everything that's pretty universal in Tumblr's theme standards.

### Future plans

Tumblr Boilerplate is based heavily on [hisnameisjimmy/HTML5Boilerplate-for-Tumblr](https://github.com/hisnameisjimmy/HTML5Boilerplate-for-Tumblr). I'm currently working on rewriting the entire post layouts, with clearer CSS hierarchy.

Currently, Tumblr Boilerplate is only suitable for themes running on single-column layouts, but a separate branch that supports two-column layouts (with sidebar) may be added in the future.

It's currently still in early development stage, so most features are probably still missing!
