# Tumblr Boilerplate

Tumblr Boilerplate is a base HTML framework for Tumblr themes, based on [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://h5bp.com).

The goal of Tumblr Boilerplate is to provide a barebones HTML framework for advanced Tumblr theme designers, without ruining functionality and usability, so theme designers can focus mostly on CSS.

## Features

### Core features

Tumblr Boilerplate includes almost all style classes included within the [themes documentation](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes), complete with grab-and-go advanced features features that can be easily applied, like Google Analytics tracking, Disqus comments, everything that's pretty universal in Tumblr's theme standards.

All Normalize, H5BP, and Custom CSS styles are also dropped into the `<style>` tag on the HTML file. This means theme designers can work on the CSS straight away without having to worry about uploading custom CSS files into the Tumblr Static Uploader.

### Future plans

Tumblr Boilerplate is still in early development stage, so most features are probably still missing. 

At the moment, it's just merely a barebones HTML framework with no styling whatsoever, in the future we might also add a basic theme, demonstrating the features of Tumblr Boilerplate.

Other features such as support for endless scroling might also be added, but it's not currently on the top of the list.
