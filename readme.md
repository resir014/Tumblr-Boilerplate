# Tumblr Boilerplate

Tumblr Boilerplate is a base HTML framework for Tumblr themes.

The goal of Tumblr Boilerplate is to provide a base standard of everything that Tumblr offers, so theme designers can focus mostly on CSS editing.

## Features

Tumblr Boilerplate is based heavily on [hisnameisjimmy/HTML5Boilerplate-for-Tumblr](https://github.com/hisnameisjimmy/HTML5Boilerplate-for-Tumblr).

This version of the repo will add and remove some features from the original, with grab-and-go features that can be easily applied universally, like Google Analytics tracking, Disqus comments, everything that's pretty universal in Tumblr's theme standards.

For now, it's only suitable for themes running on single-column layouts, but a separate branch that supports two layouts (including sidebar) will be added in the future.

## Components

* HTML5 Boilerplate (version 4.3.0)
* Normalize.css (version 2.1.3)
* jQuery (version 1.10.2)
* Modernizr (version 2.7.1)
