# Tumblr Boilerplate

Tumblr Boilerplate is a base HTML framework for Tumblr themes, based on [Normalize](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).

The goal of Tumblr Boilerplate is to provide a barebones HTML framework for advanced Tumblr theme designers, without ruining functionality and usability, so theme designers can focus mostly on CSS.

## Features

### Core features

Tumblr Boilerplate includes almost all style classes included within the [themes documentation](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes), complete with grab-and-go advanced features features that can be easily applied, like Google Analytics tracking, Disqus comments, everything that's pretty universal in Tumblr's theme standards.

### Future plans

Tumblr Boilerplate is still in early development stage, so most features are probably still missing. 

At the moment, it's just merely a barebones HTML framework with no styling whatsoever, in the future we might also add a basic theme, demonstrating the features of Tumblr Boilerplate.

Other features such as support for endless scroling might also be added, but it's not currently on the top of the list.
